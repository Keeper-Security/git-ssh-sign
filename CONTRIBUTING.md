- Writing code
- Improving documentation

Please ensure that your contributions align with the project's goals and follow the guidelines below.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before creating a pull request (PR), please ensure you create an issue first, if one does not already exist. This achieves two things:

1. It ensures technical decisions that need to be made can be discussed *before* you start writing code, leading to less refactoring and change requests before merging your code. 
2. It ensures the bug or feature you are contributing to is documented showing other contributors that this bug/feature is being worked on, avoiding the unfortunate problem of having more than one PR for the same bug/feature.

To get started on your PR: 

- Fork the repository and create a new branch.
- Make sure your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Test your changes thoroughly.
- Update the documentation if necessary.
- Submit a pull request, explaining the purpose of the changes and any relevant information.
